# Twenty Twenty-Three Child
<p>A child theme is a sub-theme that inherits the look, feel, and functions of the parent theme. When you make modifications to the child theme, they are kept separate from the parent theme's files.</p>
<h3>A Child theme for Twenty Twenty-Three WordPress Theme</h3>
<p>With this child theme you can add basic or advance <b>Custom Post Types</b> as the required code for them is written in relative file <b>functions.php</b>, also you can add those as many as you want by copying & pasting the code multiple times & change the name & attributes according to your <b>Custom Post Type</b> liking.</p>
<h4>Make This Child Theme Yours</h4>
<p>To make it your's Child Theme you need a just little bit changes in <b>style.css</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Make a folder with you parent theme name with adding "-child" in my case <b>twentytwentythree</b> (parent theme folder name) <b>twentytwentythree-child</b> (child theme folder name) & paste these files into child folder.</li>
  <li>Go to <b>style.css</b> change the theme name to the theme you're working on at the top of the comment.</li>
  <li>Change the template to the theme folder name you want to make this a Child Theme, in my case its <b>twentytwentythree</b>.</li>
  <li>Activate it & have fun with it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>NOTES</h3>
